Bella. Hi. I would like to begin by acknowledging that this is . . . unusual? But you're here now, so please stay with me.

This might seem awkward, though that's just what I'm like. Communication has never been my strong point.

What I'm trying to say is this: I was wrong. Not just once - I've been doing everything wrong for as long as I can remember. What can I say? I'm only human. That said, I still have regrets, and moving on means correcting myself first.

Some might say I'm too late - maybe even most - but I say late is better than never. I know my conduct was horrendous, and words cannot describe how sorry I am, and forever will be. No one should ever have to be in your position, and no one should ever act as immaturely as I did. I just want you to know.

I won't ever be perfect: I won't ever be the best person on the planet - regardless of all the glazing I get! But I don't care, because I'm willing to learn, and that's better than most. I believe if I'm better off at the end of the day than at the start of it, even if only slightly, then that day has been worth living.

It dawned on me just before my 16th birthday (back in December) that time passes too quickly. And it became clear: nothing would change, not unless I changed myself first. I told myself that 2026 would be my year. For the first time, I believed it.

I'm still the same person - still incredibly introverted (as always). What *is* different is my attitude. I now chase what I need, not comfort. And that includes you; we both know what happened two years ago, how I ruined the moment, and I can only *imagine* how you felt. You reached out, I ignored it, and now it's my turn: I love you Bella, I really do. No one else compares, and you deserve to know that.
